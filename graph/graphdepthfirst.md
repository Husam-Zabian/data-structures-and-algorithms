# graph depth first

## Feature Tasks

Write the depth first for the Graph class that Return A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order visited.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Time complexity : O(N + M)
Space complexity : O(N)

N is the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph, and M is the number of edges

## Solution
